This code computes the disease enrichment of provided set of SNPs and writes the output to tab-delimited files.
It takes 4 inputs to calculate the enrichment p-value
inputs:
1) Text file containing peak coordinates and specificity scores for each of the analyzed samples
2) Directory with LD information for each SNP
3) Name of the analyzed trait
4) Directory where to output results

usage:
python CHEERS_computeEnrichment.py --input data.txt --ld ~/LD/trait/ --trait trait_name --outdir ~/output/directory/
or 
python CHEERS_computeEnrichment.py --input data.txt --snp_list snp_list.txt --trait trait_name --outdir ~/output/directory/
